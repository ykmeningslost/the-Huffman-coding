# the-Huffman-coding
The program receives a string, full of latin-chars only and outputs chars-to-its-code table and binary representations of recieved string. 
Program output: 
First string : amount of different characters in accepted string (let's call it 'dif_chars_amount') and the total length of string in binary representation;
Next 'dif-chars-amount' strings: char and its binary code;
The last string, finally: binary representation of recieved string. 
Side note: of course, the binary representation converts back to a regular string in only one way. 
Side note n.2: the program outputs the shortest binary string that can be created depends on input string.
